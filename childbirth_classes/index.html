               <h3>Black Sheep Birth Services offers in-person, Home & Birth Center Childbirth Classes. </h3>If you are planning to have your
               baby at home or at a freestanding birth center, this is the class for you! Recommended by local midwives. Come learn
               about the process of labor and birth, comfort measure techniques, relaxation methods, interventions, & more. Classes are
               typically held every other month and taught at Willow Women's & Childrens Wellness (aka the Aurora Birth Center). This
               class is divided into five, 2.5 hour sessions and is taught by a Certified Childbirth Educator (CBE). Each session is
               scheduled to begin promptly at 6:00 PM.* The investment is $250 with a $75.00 nonrefundable deposit due at the time of
               registration to guarantee your spot.

            <ul>
               <li>
                  We recommend that you schedule your class to begin around 30-34 weeks gestation so you have time to complete the
                  series before you give birth. (Remember, babies don't always come on their due date and you'll want to be prepared!)
               </li>
               <li>
                  This class is designed for couples because we want both partners to be well prepared. (If you are a single parent or
                  have another unique situation, please don't hesitate to contact us to discuss.)
               </li>
               <li>
                  This class is open to the public. Clients of the Aurora Birth Center receive a $25 discount on their tuition. Space is
                  limited.
               </li>
               <li>

                  <p>When planning for an amazing birth, education is key! However, when the classes are over and you still need support at
                  the birth itself, hiring a Birth Boot Camp Doula can help. Studies have shown that having a doula decreases the risk of
                  having a cesarean, shortens the length of labor, and improves the overall satisfaction of the birth experience.</p>
