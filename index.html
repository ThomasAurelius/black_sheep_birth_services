            <p>Welcome! And congratulations on your upcoming birth. My name is Sierra. I'm a wife, mother of three, trained labor doula
            and certified <a href="">childbirth educator</a>. My passion for supporting women and families during pregnancy and birth began after I
            experienced the birth of my first child. Since then, I have trained as a labor doula through CAPPA (Childbirth and
            Postpartum Professional Association) and am a certified Birth Boot Camp Instructor (childbirth educator). Combined with
            my work as a doula, childbirth educator, and my own experience as a mother of three, I have over 10 years of experience
            with pregnancy, birth, and beyond!</p>

               <p>Your doula is hired by and for you and tends to you and your family’s needs even before the birth of your baby. From
               emotional support before, during and just after birth, to easing the transition into the birth environment and helping
               all providers understand and value your birth wishes. Your doula is your trusted advocate, labor coach, and resource.</p>

               <p>There's a famous quote in the birth world from Diana Korte and Roberta Scaer that says, “If you don't know your options, you don't have any”. At Black Sheep Birth Services, we offer a wide variety of Birth Boot Camp online and in person
               classes, so you know every option available to you and can make the best, informed choices for you and your family.
               Classes include childbirth preparation for every birth environment, including an online breastfeeding class, “bringing home baby”, and more!
