            <h2>Sierra Smith, Labor Doula</h2>
            <p>Welcome! And congratulations on your upcoming birth. My name is Sierra. I'm a wife, mother of three, trained labor doula
            and certified <a href="">childbirth educator</a>. My passion for supporting women and families during pregnancy and birth began after I
            experienced the birth of my first child. Since then, I have trained as a labor doula through CAPPA (Childbirth and
            Postpartum Professional Association) and am a certified Birth Boot Camp Instructor (childbirth educator). Combined with
            my work as a doula, childbirth educator, and my own experience as a mother of three, I have over 10 years of experience
            with pregnancy, birth, and beyond!</p>

                  <p>A doula is a person who attends the birthing family before, during, and just after the birth of the baby. The doula is
                  trained to deliver emotional support from home to hospital, ease the transition into the hospital environment, and be
                  there through changing hospital shifts and alternating provider schedules. The doula serves as an advocate, labor coach,
                  and information source to give the mother and her partner the added comfort of additional support throughout the entire
                  labor. There are a variety of titles used by women offering these kinds of services such as "birth assistant," "labor
                  support specialist" and "doula".</p>

                     Research has shown that having a doula present at a birth:

                        <li>Decreases the need for pain medication</li>

                  A doula provides physical and emotional support throughout your entire labor and birth. Early labor this is usually via
                  phone call or text. Active labor this is physical support, comfort measures, verbal reassurance, etc. This all depends
                  on how you plan to birth and what your wishes are. I've assisted women in births where they wish to have zero medication
                  and I've assisted women who want an epidural as soon as they arrive to the hospital. I'm happy to support you in the
                  unique way that you require.

                  <p>
                     Absolutely not! In fact, many partners enjoy having the support of a doula to help guide them in making sure their
                     partner is as comfortable as possible. Many partners also find comfort in knowing that mom is not alone, should they
                     need to use the restroom, eat a snack, or even take a nap. ​

                     Unlike doctors, midwives, and nurses, doulas are not medical professionals. I do not perform clinical tasks such as
                     blood pressure checks, fetal heart monitoring, vaginal exams, catch your baby, etc. I provide only physical, emotional,
                     and educational support.
      
                     <br>
                     <br>
      
                     Doulas do not make decisions for you or speak on your behalf to medical professionals, but I can discuss concerns with
                     you, and support you during discussions with medical staff. This may involve helping you get the information you need,
                     hearing all the options, and making suggestions to help you make your own informed decisions.

                     Birth is a personal and intimate experience. I encourage you to interview more than one doula. The most important
                     decision when choosing a doula is to find one that you and your partner both feel comfortable with. Ask yourself who you
                     felt most heard and supported by and with whom you had the best connection. I believe it is vital for doulas and clients
                     to have an ease of conversation and mutual trust. Don't be afraid to get a little personal in your interview!
