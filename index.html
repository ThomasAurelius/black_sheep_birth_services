            <h2>Sierra Smith, Labor Doula</h2>
            <p>Welcome! And congratulations on your upcoming birth. My name is Sierra. I'm a wife, mother of three, trained labor doula
            and certified <a href="">childbirth educator</a>. My passion for supporting women and families during pregnancy and birth began after I
            experienced the birth of my first child. Since then, I have trained as a labor doula through CAPPA (Childbirth and
            Postpartum Professional Association) and am a certified Birth Boot Camp Instructor (childbirth educator). Combined with
            my work as a doula, childbirth educator, and my own experience as a mother of three, I have over 10 years of experience
            with pregnancy, birth, and beyond!</p>

                  <p>A doula is a person who attends the birthing family before, during, and just after the birth of the baby. The doula is
                  trained to deliver emotional support from home to hospital, ease the transition into the hospital environment, and be
                  there through changing hospital shifts and alternating provider schedules. The doula serves as an advocate, labor coach,
                  and information source to give the mother and her partner the added comfort of additional support throughout the entire
                  labor. There are a variety of titles used by women offering these kinds of services such as "birth assistant," "labor
                  support specialist" and "doula".</p>

                     Research has shown that having a doula present at a birth:

                  A doula provides physical and emotional support throughout your entire labor and birth. Early labor this is usually via
                  phone call or text. Active labor this is physical support, comfort measures, verbal reassurance, etc. This all depends
                  on how you plan to birth and what your wishes are. I've assisted women in births where they wish to have zero medication
                  and I've assisted women who want an epidural as soon as they arrive to the hospital. I'm happy to support you in the
                  unique way that you require.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     Absolutely not! In fact, many partners enjoy having the support of a doula to help guide them in making sure their
                     partner is as comfortable as possible. Many partners also find comfort in knowing that mom is not alone, should they
                     need to use the restroom, eat a snack, or even take a nap. ​

                  <p>
                     Unlike doctors, midwives, and nurses, doulas are not medical professionals. I do not perform clinical tasks such as
                     blood pressure checks, fetal heart monitoring, vaginal exams, catch your baby, etc. I provide only physical, emotional,
                     and educational support.
      
                     <br>
                     <br>
      
                     Doulas do not make decisions for you or speak on your behalf to medical professionals, but I can discuss concerns with
                     you, and support you during discussions with medical staff. This may involve helping you get the information you need,
                     hearing all the options, and making suggestions to help you make your own informed decisions.

                     Birth is a personal and intimate experience. I encourage you to interview more than one doula. The most important
                     decision when choosing a doula is to find one that you and your partner both feel comfortable with. Ask yourself who you
                     felt most heard and supported by and with whom you had the best connection. I believe it is vital for doulas and clients
                     to have an ease of conversation and mutual trust. Don't be afraid to get a little personal in your interview!

            <h2>Services</h2>
            <h3>Complimentary Consultation</h3>
            <p>Just as every pregnancy, birth, and woman differs, so do personalities. Because of this, I offer a complimentary,
            no-obligation, meet & greet. Typically we will meet at mutually convenient location (ex. local coffee shop). Here you
            can ask any questions and get to know me a bit. Don't want to hire me? No problem! Simply contact me again if you do and
            we will go from there.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Prenatal & Labor Support</h3>
            <p>I currently provide labor support services for the Woodburn, Oregon and surrounding areas. This includes one prenatal
            visit (two if necessary), on-call support during labor, and one postnatal appointment within the first two weeks after
            giving birth.</p>
      
               <br>
            <p>
               During the first appointment we will discuss every aspect of the upcoming birth. I will work with you and your partner
               to find out what is important to you to know before giving birth. We will also discuss the risks versus benefits of
               interventions and I will share coping skills with you. At this time we will also fill out a birth plan.
            </p>
      
               <br>
      
            <p>Once in labor, you will call me and I will meet you wherever you have chosen to give birth. Once there, I will provide
            continuous support to you all through labor and delivery, and for about an hour after the birth. Within the first two
            weeks postpartum, I will do a follow up visit at your home. We can then discuss your birth, see how breastfeeding is
            going, and answer any other questions you may have.</p>

         <h2>Rates</h2>
         <p>Services are $800.00, with a $350.00 retainer due at the first appointment.
         </p>
         <p> (Please note that there is an
            additional
            $50.00 charge for those outside of a 20 mile radius.)
         </p>
         <p> I <em>truly believe</em> that any woman who wants a doula should be
            able to
            have one so the fee may be done on a sliding scale or by bartering if necessary. Please feel free to contact me if
            you
            have any questions or concerns.

            <h2>Additional Information</h2>
            <p>
            When planning for a new addition, I know that costs can add up quickly. This is why I offer clients a payment plan if
            necessary. These are things we will discuss at your first appointment, but I like to be transparent and upfront from the
            beginning. A retainer is due at our first appointment (after your consultation). This is where we go over the contract,
            what my position is at your birth, what your expectations are, etc. This is often a one or two hour visit at your home.
            (No need to clean before I arrive! I'm not judging mama.)</p>
      
         <br>
      
            <p>
               The next step is simply keeping in continuous contact, whether by phone call, text or email. I am at your service to
               answer questions, and be of any assistance I can until I get that exciting phone call. (We may also meet for an
               additional prenatal visit during this time, if necessary.) After we have made contact and you're in labor, I will have
               an hour to join you. Once I arrive, I will support you physically and emotionally throughout the entirety of your labor
               and birth. I'm also happy to snap a few photos for you if you wish (using your own phone/device), but please note that
               I'm no professional birth photographer and this is not my focus.
            </p>
      
            <br>
            <p>After an hour or so after the birth, I will leave you and your family to soak in all of the sweet new baby goodness. I
            will be in contact in the following weeks to schedule a follow-up postpartum visit. (And to see that sweet new baby
            again!) At this time I will check in with you, see how breastfeeding is going, everyone is adjusting to their new
            normal, etc. If you require additional assistance, I will also provide additional resources at this time.</p>
