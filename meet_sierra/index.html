            <h1>Meet Sierra</h1>
            <br>
            <h3>Hello again!</h3>
            <p>
               To be quite honest, deciding what to write here is a bit intimidating so I'll just jump right in... I'm a sassy,
               passionate, devoted, natural brunette in my early thirties. I was raised right here in the beautiful Pacific Northwest.
               Three unruly little humans call me mama. (Well, one is too small but she'll be talking before we know it!) I'm married
               to a wonderful partner and USMC veteran, David. We have a rescue dog named Zeus. I enjoy hiking, trying new places, and
               coffee. (Lots of coffee. In fact, Dutch Bros is my love language.) I also really enjoy crocheting and other various
               crafts and DIY projects when I have time.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Let's talk birth!</h3>
            <p>
               Like I mentioned before, my first baby started it all. I was a young military spouse, planning to give birth at the
               local military hospital. What I experienced was not the care I wanted to receive. Long appointment waits, never seeing
               the same provider, providers not respecting my wishes, and so on. I eventually got fed up and started researching my
               options and ended up moving back to Washington to have a home birth with midwives. (Crazy, I know!) Though I had such an
               empowering experience that I went on to birth each of my consecutive pregnancies in our home, with the assistance of
               midwives. I also have experience with extended breastfeeding, tandem breastfeeding, babywearing, cloth diapering and
               more.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Professional Accomplishments</h3>
            <p>
               Since the birth of my first child in 2008, I have completed a CAPPA Labor Doula Distance Training, a Waterbirth
               Certification Workshop through Waterbirth International, certified as a Birth Boot Camp Instructor, and have attended a
               cultural competency workshop through Bastyr University. I've attended numerous local community events surrounding
               childbirth, breastfeeding and beyond. I most recently joined Birthingway College of Midwifery here in Portland, Oregon,
               as an Executive Board Member. I have attended about a dozen or so births in the hospital, birthing center, and home
               environments.
