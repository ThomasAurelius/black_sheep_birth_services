            <h2>Labor Doula Services</h2>
            <h3>Complimentary Consultation</h3>
            <p>Just as every pregnancy, birth, and woman differs, so do personalities. Because of this, I offer a
               complimentary,
               no-obligation, meet & greet. Typically we will meet at mutually convenient location (ex. local coffee shop).
               Here you
               can ask any questions and get to know me a bit. Don't want to hire me? No problem! Simply contact me again if
               you do and
               we will go from there.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Prenatal & Labor Support</h3>
            <p>I currently provide labor support services for the Woodburn, Oregon and surrounding areas. This includes one
               prenatal
               visit (two if necessary), on-call support during labor, and one postnatal appointment within the first two
               weeks after
               giving birth.</p>
      
            <br>
            <p>
               During the first appointment we will discuss every aspect of the upcoming birth. I will work with you and your
               partner
               to find out what is important to you to know before giving birth. We will also discuss the risks versus
               benefits of
               interventions and I will share coping skills with you. At this time we will also fill out a birth plan.
            </p>
      
            <br>
      
            <p>Once in labor, you will call me and I will meet you wherever you have chosen to give birth. Once there, I will
               provide
               continuous support to you all through labor and delivery, and for about an hour after the birth. Within the
               first two
               weeks postpartum, I will do a follow up visit at your home. We can then discuss your birth, see how
               breastfeeding is
               going, and answer any other questions you may have.</p>

            <h2>Additional Information</h2>
            <p>
               When planning for a new addition, I know that costs can add up quickly. This is why I offer clients a payment
               plan if
               necessary. These are things we will discuss at your first appointment, but I like to be transparent and upfront
               from the
               beginning. A retainer is due at our first appointment (after your consultation). This is where we go over the
               contract,
               what my position is at your birth, what your expectations are, etc. This is often a one or two hour visit at
               your home.
               (No need to clean before I arrive! I'm not judging mama.)</p>
      
            
      
            <p>
               The next step is simply keeping in continuous contact, whether by phone call, text or email. I am at your
               service to
               answer questions, and be of any assistance I can until I get that exciting phone call. (We may also meet for an
               additional prenatal visit during this time, if necessary.) After we have made contact and you're in labor, I
               will have
               an hour to join you. Once I arrive, I will support you physically and emotionally throughout the entirety of
               your labor
               and birth. I'm also happy to snap a few photos for you if you wish (using your own phone/device), but please
               note that
               I'm no professional birth photographer and this is not my focus.
            </p>
      
            
            <p>After an hour or so after the birth, I will leave you and your family to soak in all of the sweet new baby
               goodness. I
               will be in contact in the following weeks to schedule a follow-up postpartum visit. (And to see that sweet new
               baby
               again!) At this time I will check in with you, see how breastfeeding is going, everyone is adjusting to their
               new
               normal, etc. If you require additional assistance, I will also provide additional resources at this time.</p>

         <h2>Rates</h2>
         <p>Services are $800.00, with a $350.00 retainer due at the first appointment.

         <p> (Please note that there is an

         <p> I <em>truly believe</em> that any woman who wants a doula should be
            able to
            have one so the fee may be done on a sliding scale or by bartering if necessary. Please feel free to contact me if
